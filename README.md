# [Project 1: Estimating the value of Pi using inscribed circle and Circumscribed circle with Python](https://github.com/BilalMaqsood-ai/Bilal_Portfolio/blob/main/Estimating%20the%20value%20pi%20.ipynb)
*	Coded a favorite interview question of estimating the value of pi using an equilateral triangle.
*	Defined a function to call and try different values for for loop iteration.
*	Estimated the value of pi by up to 3 digits accurate after decimal points.
*	Plotted the scatter plot of the points using matplotlib library to visualize the results.
*	Tried the same for a Circumscribed circle
