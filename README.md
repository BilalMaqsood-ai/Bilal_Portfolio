# [Project 1: Estimating the value of Pi using inscribed circle and Circumscribed circle with Python](https://github.com/BilalMaqsood-ai/Bilal_Portfolio/blob/main/Estimating%20the%20value%20pi%20.ipynb)
* Coded a favourite interview question of estimating the value of pi using an equilateral triangle.
* Defined a function to call and try different values for for loop iteration.
* Estimated the value of pi by upto 3 digits accurate after decimal points.
* Plotted the scatter plot of the points using matplotlib library to visualise the results.
* Tried the same for a Circumscribed circle
